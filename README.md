## Game

* The number of mines is set to 40 by default on an 18 x 14 game board.
* You can see your current time in seconds counting up next to the clock icon.
* Right click with your mouse to set "flags" where you suspect mines to be. 
* When you successfully finish the game, your winning time will be recorded in the upper right so you can race against yourself.

Should you click a tile with a mine, expect to see game over!
